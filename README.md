# Wireframing: From Wireframe to Prototype

## Introduction to Wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a **visual guide** that represents the skeletal framework of a user interface.  
It serves as a blueprint for designing websites, apps, or software systems by outlining layout, navigation, and functionality **before development begins**.  

**Importance:**  
- Helps communicate design ideas clearly among stakeholders.  
- Identifies usability challenges early in the design process.  
- Guides developers and designers to focus on structure before styling.

## Key Elements of Wireframing
1. **Layout Structure**  
   - Defines the arrangement of elements on the screen.  
   - Example: Placement of header, sidebar, content area, and footer.  

2. **Navigation**  
   - Shows how users will move through the system.  
   - Example: Menu bars, buttons, links, and page flow.  

3. **Content Placement**  
   - Determines where text, images, and multimedia will appear.  
   - Example: Positioning of headlines, images, and forms.  

4. **Functionality**  
   - Illustrates interactive elements and system responses.  
   - Example: Search bars, dropdowns, buttons, and input fields.

## Types of Wireframes
### **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**
- Basic sketches or digital outlines of pages.  
- Focus on **structure and layout**, not visual details.  
- Used early in the design process to brainstorm ideas quickly.  

### **High-Fidelity Wireframes**
- Detailed digital mockups that closely resemble the final product.  
- Include **colors, typography, and detailed content**.  
- Used to validate design before actual development begins.  

**Example:**  
- Low-Fidelity: Hand-drawn layout of a booking page.  
- High-Fidelity: Detailed Figma mockup showing room selection, booking form, and checkout button.

## Wireframing Tools
Several tools help designers create wireframes efficiently:  
- **Figma:** Collaborative design tool for creating interactive wireframes and prototypes.  
- **Balsamiq:** Rapid wireframing tool with a focus on low-fidelity sketches.  
- **Adobe XD:** Used for designing and prototyping interfaces with interactivity.  

**Why Figma?**  
- Real-time collaboration  
- Easy sharing with stakeholders  
- Supports both low- and high-fidelity wireframes  
- Interactive prototyping features

## Benefits of Wireframing in Software Development
- **Clear Communication:** Aligns stakeholders and team members on design expectations.  
- **Early Usability Testing:** Identifies potential user experience issues before coding.  
- **Saves Time and Cost:** Reduces costly revisions during development.  
- **Guides Development:** Provides developers with a clear blueprint to implement features efficiently.

## Wireframing in Practice
**Scenario:**  
During the design of a booking management system, low-fidelity wireframes revealed that the checkout page had too many steps, which could confuse users.  

**Resolution:**  
- Consolidated steps into a single-page checkout.  
- Added clear progress indicators and simplified forms.  

**Impact:**  
- Improved user experience  
- Reduced abandoned bookings  
- Streamlined development process  

**Conclusion:**  
Wireframing ensures **user-friendly design**, improves team communication, and mitigates usability risks before development starts.

## Next Steps
- Commit your README.md to your GitHub repository `wireframing`.  
- Optionally include screenshots of wireframes or Figma prototypes.  
- Request **manual QA review** once complete.
